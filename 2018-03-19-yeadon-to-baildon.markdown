It feels like I've been stuck in the house for weeks. A combination of an ill child and snow has made getting out and about too much like hard work. After another weekend of sideways snow swishing in and out as if to say 'and another thing...', Monday dawned chilly but bright. My wife decided she was going shopping in Yeadon so it seemed a good opportunity to start exploring again.

I lived in Yeadon for six years. Despite being next to the airport it's fairly quiet by day - locals will tell you it's because planes take off beside the town, and despite being able to see largish airliners shooting up over the houses, it just becomes part of the rhythm of life. On this Monday the market was on as always, now only a handful of stalls that had been pushed to the end of the square in front of the alpine Town Hall, made more so by the sprinkling of left-over snow on its roof.

Yeadon is at the top of a hill, which reverses the norm of similar Victorian mill communities: usually the owners and managers lived on the hill, and workers lived below. Here, Yeadon was where the mills and the workers were, with the better off staff coming up from Rawdon and Guiseley. It was also where the entertainment was.

I'm here to walk down the hill and into the Aire Valley by a route off the roads. This is also something that is rather rare in the area as many footpaths have been built over or neglected. There aren't that many walks in the area but an awful lot of phantoms and dead ends.

There is one route that has been well preserved: today, as there's continual talk of better connections to the airport, there's a path that recalls the high age of steam when the railway at least made a go of climbing the hill from Guiseley.

Starting at the Town Hall, head a few metres downhill to where Town Street is crossed by Silver Lane and Ivegate. In front of you is the continuation of Town Street known as The Steep, a short stretch of cobbles at a gradient of 20% or so that cuts the corner of Well Hill and meets the top of Kirk Lane. However, turn left and follow Ivegate to its junction with Kirk Lane and cross over. Here on the left is Kettleys, the local furniture store and funeral director, star of Channel 5's 'The Fixer' in 2012, a shop of a type in decline but one that is thriving after over 70 years in business.

Cross Kirk Lane at the junction with Henshaw Lane. The Amalfi Italian restaurant was, as you might imagine, a pub, called The Tarn despite being a distance from the semi-artificial lake by the airport of the same name. It was a good local pub that in its last (or so) phase did well as a real ale pub and live music venue but like many got sold off as the giant pubcos rearranged themselves.

Henshaw Lane is mostly 1920s stuccoed semis in contrast to the limestone block terraces of the older part of the village on top of the hill. The Leeds trams reached Yeadon and Guiseley in 1909, which must have contributed to the new growth of the area, making it possible to reach the city in an hour or so without having to walk or ride to Guiseley, Horsforth or Apperley Bridge and also prematurely put an end to the passenger plans of the London Midland Yeadon branch line. Yeadon station was goods only and closed in 1964, having only been used as a passenger station for special excursions. The company formed to promote the line, planned from Guiseley to Rawdon via Yeadon, was absorbed by the London Midland in the latter part of the 1890s, who were seemingly reluctant to run much traffic at all along the line, servicing the mills and businesses of Yeadon with light goods but apparently drawing the line at coal and other heavy traffic, which still had to be collected from Guiseley.
Walk down the hill. You will reach the remains of a railway bridge and a pub that is still called The Station. Engine Fields is accessed down the side of the remains of the line and was the location of a small yard and mill ponds which has since become a popular area for dog walking and the local youth to congregate. The old trackbed is now paved and well maintained and leads out of the park and down to Guiseley.

Like a lot of Victorian engineering, it is two miles or so of permanent way, slightly buried in a now-built up cutting. Houses of all ages back onto it and paths feed into it. It passes under three bridges that carry busy roads, Whack House Lane, St John's Road and the A65, called New Road at this point. Streams and runnels trickle around the embankments and paths lead off into the housing estates that have been built at different times over the last hundred years.

On the other side of New Road, in an area called New Scarborough (still signposted from the roundabout at the top of Town Street) new estates aggregate, and the path crosses the working Wharfedale Line where it and the Yeadon branch once connected at Rawdon Junction.

On the other side of tracks there are footpaths across the fields that descend to Esholt, but as the snow and rain has churned the paths into frozen mud we walk along Coach Road, around the edge of the Silverdale Estate. There are several Coach Roads in the area, which, as the name suggests, were built to accomodate passenger carriages as they became more common in the mid-19th century. The location of this one suggests the boundary of an old estate, which is supported by the high, mossy walls that line the south side of Park Road. The  more modern estates give way to the late Victorian Park Road and the older walls of Hawkhill, which from the outside is has appearance of the remains of an ancient pile but seems to be a model estate built for the late Victorian middle class.

Before the busy junction of Park Road and Bradford Road, we turn left onto Old Hollins Hill, which takes us steeply up and then down giving us the first view of - at last - the Aire Valley as we descend towards Esholt. The transition to countryside is still abrupt as the road narrows and twists down under the viaduct that carries the Airedale Line over the river. This is a casually spectacular piece of engineering, one of two that carry the line across the valley.

Esholt is a small village in a hollow surrounded by river and hills. It had a railway station until 1940 but now the Airedale line passes over it. It's a short walk from Bradford Road and nominally part of Baildon town but remains quietly detached. For twenty years its pub, the Commercial Inn, was known to the country as Emmerdale's [Woolpack](the-woolpack-esholt.html) and its exterior became an unofficial visitor attraction. The name became official in the 90s and even now, despite Emmerdale now being filmed at purpose-built village near Harewood, and the new visitor experience in Leeds, it still attracts tourists and trades on its past in a low key fashion.

Walk up Station Road to Hollins Hill. Across the road is the Marriot, but turn left and continue down the hill to where it becomes Otley Road, which is also where Gill Beck crosses the road and was once a slightly quirky historical boundary of the type that the 1974 Local Goverment Act ironed out. It is also the entrance to Tong Park, a name which is shared by an industrial estate carved out of an old mill complex, the historical park behind it and another small village hidden in the woods. There are deer here too, which can be seen from the road, occasionally crossing it, and recently spotted down near Esholt.

The area beyond this is where Baildon starts. Industry is expanding on the riverward side of the road, further up than it was in the days of the mills. New light industrial units run the length of the road from Hoyle Court onwards, merging with the older industries of Charlestown. Here on the left is the New Inn, carved out of a row of weavers' houses. Opposite is the Halfway House, more a restaurant than a pub and one that is popular in the area. You can catch the 737 airport bus here, either back to Guiseley or to Bradford.

From the New Inn, follow Fyfe Lane up the hill and fork right. There is a public footpath on the north side of the road that takes you through the tiny hamlet of Brook Hill to Station Road. From here you can turn right and follow the road down to Baildon railway station, or left and up the hill to Baildon Road and up Browgate to the village centre to pick up buses to Shipley and Bradford.
