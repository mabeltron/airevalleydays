Summary: A visit to the Woolpack in Esholt
Status: published
---

The Woolpack, or its outside at least, is as iconic an exterior as those other soap boozers, the Queen Vic and the Rover's Return. Filming moved away to a badly kept secret location some years ago but the pub still earns its living from visitors on the Emmerdale trail.

Esholt itself is a picturesque village by the Aire and the Leeds-Liverpool canal, between Guiseley and Baildon, somewhat at odds with the industry crawling up the hill in Baildon. It supports tourism remarkably well, with a coach-sized car park between the viaduct and the village and walking routes in the hills and woods above it.

The pub sits in a square bounded by cottages and the post office, immediately recognisable from the telly. Inside it's somewhat different, a panelled, stone floored old fashioned drinker across two rooms, the small snug to the right as you enter and the larger lounge and restaurant to the left. It only does food at lunchtimes and not on Mondays and Tuesdays but the menu is good if small. Business is certainly better on a summer Friday for example.

The beer selection consists of local standards, usually Timothy Taylor Landlord, Moorhouse Woolpack (basically Blonde Witch rebadged for the pub) and Otter Bitter, from a Devon brewery  but which I think has Emmerdale links. There's a fourth handpull that has carried Copper Dragon Golden Pippin in the past but I think has also had Saltaire Blonde, the local cask of choice. The risers have John Smiths bitter and a couple of less obvious lagers (Moretti and Peroni I think) and in all it caters for its trades.

The beer garden and car park are pleasant on summer days and there is a small playground.
Like a lot of village pubs it must be a labour of love, probably with enough weekend business to keep it going, but it has the added bonus of being a bona fide attraction, official or not, which must be a blessing and a curse for any pub.
