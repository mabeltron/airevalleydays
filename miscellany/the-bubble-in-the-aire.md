Summary: How Wharfedale once crossed the Aire

At the bottom of Hollins Hill in Baildon, where the road crosses Gill Beck on its way to the Aire, there is a boundary marker between Baildon Urban District Council and Wharfedale Rural District Council. Both government units that have long gone of course - Wharfedale was replaced by Aireborough in 1937 and Baildon was absorbed into Bradford in 1974, and the marker is a reminder of the way in which boundaries were decided and how the decisions have stayed with us until today.

The 1894 Local Government Act created the basis for the system of local government that has been used since. Districts were formed out of a combination of existing parishes, drainage and sanitary boards, boards of guardians of poor law unions and school boards. Baildon was a simple one: the village was a single poor law district formed in 1852 and as it grew as a mill town and a commuter town for Shipley and Bradford it was incorporated as an Urban District in 1894.

Wharfedale on the other hand sprawled across most of the rural north-western edge of Leeds, from Adel to Hawksworth and Esholt, an aggregation of the rural parishes in the Wharfe and Washburn valleys. The village of Hawksworth, on the east side of Otley Road Guiseley and the Aire, was included, as was Esholt, which was a detached part, and which is partly why the boundary stone exists.

In 1937, the urban district of Aireborough was formed out of Guiseley, Yeadon, Rawdon, Menston and Hawksworth to reflect the changing nature of the area.

In 1974, Aireborough became part of Leeds as did Hawksworth. The boundary moved a few hundred yards up the hill, but the modern local authority map still has this bubble at the north-western edge of Leeds. Despite being attached to Guiseley through the Tranmere Park estate, Hawksworth still has the air of a detached village on the edge of Baildon Moor.

What I can't find at the moment is why Esholt was detached in 1894. It was a parish in its own right but associated with Guiseley. It is not represented on Baildon Town Council today.
