Summary: a visit to the New Inn in Baildon

The New Inn is a row of weavers' cottages on Otley Road. It's very much a locals pub that serves the houses behind and around it and presumably the industrial estates and factories on the other side of the road. I've known it in passing for probably 15 years, from driving to Bradford from Yeadon and more recently visiting my in-laws just around the corner. It has had mixed fortunes in that time, seemingly trapped in the 18 month cycle of occupation that many pubco pubs fall into. It's an Enterprise pub, or more correctly a Craft Union pub now, as Enterprise has carved up its brands into several businesses since too many people noticed that they were often more interested in bricks and mortar than the actual business of running pubs.

To that end, the name Craft Union seems, scientifically based on this one example, misleading at best. I'll explain.

On this Monday afternoon in March, I looked in for the second time in a year or so. Two handpulls, with cask Tetley and Hook Norton Hop To It, and a forest of risers. I had a pint of the Hop To It and took a seat. The pub is house width (oddly enough) and laid out in that late-80s/early 90s raised area design where you step up from the bar area onto platforms with a mix of benches and seats around tables.

A brewery rep was in and it gradually transpired that the previous management team had literally walked out that day and been replaced by a temporary manager to provide some continuity. She and the cellarman were sorting out what they needed and the general view was 'keep the Carling coming'.

There was a promo leaflet scattered around the pub which offered deals on lager and multi-coloured drinks, but little that actually said 'craft', even by the most liberal interpretation of the word.

My pint was decent enough, a 3.8% pale of the kind that the nationals describe as 'hoppy', and I've had Tetley's there before, which can still be good even if it's made a long way from home these days, but it was clear that this isn't their core business, and I started to wonder if the brand was given to other pubs in this state, just doing enough business to keep going but not enough to make a good living. Probably in places like this where it was that thought that the name reflected the people who drank there. At least the doors hadn't stayed closed when the management had dropped the keys off at the office as has happened before to that pub on a number of occasions, but sitting in the pub for half an hour seemed indicative of the state of that side of the business and I don't doubt that somewhere in the big company decisions would be being made about its viability, and they would probably fall on the side of giving another set of hopefuls a go for another eighteen months. It seems like it deserves so much more but it would as always take a bit of vision to do that, and that is rarely entertained or tolerated in the pubcos.
