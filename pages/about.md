The Aire is a long river: 148 km from Malham Tarn to the Ouse at Airmyn. It loops across Yorkshire and has contributed to the growth of the county throughout human existence. Where it passes through Leeds and Bradford it is both built up and rural, a natural boundary between the two cities and a green breathing space. Between Skipton and Shipley, the river, roads and rail are intertwined in a narrow area that passes through and around towns and villages that grew on Victorian agricultural prosperity. There is the World Heritage Site of Saltaire, the literary mecca of the Brontes at Haworth, bustling Keighley, the great paleolithic bulk of Rombalds Moor and the scenic Dales are within easy reach.
There is nothing authoritive about this, it's just a collection of personal views of things that interest me about the area I live in, assembled during infrequent walks and train trips along the Airedale Line. Errors and omissions are, as always, gratefully corrected.
